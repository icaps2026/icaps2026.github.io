The [International Conference on Automated Planning and
Scheduling](https://www.icaps-conference.org) (ICAPS) is
the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and
applications of intelligent and automated planning and scheduling technology.

Planning and Scheduling are optimisation problems which require finding a set of actions to complete a task, to achieve a goal, or to optimise one or more objectives. Effective solutions to planning and scheduling problems are critical for a variety of important application areas, including Industry 4.0, aerospace systems, supply chain management, software engineering, robotics, education, digital entertainment and more.

**ICAPS 2026** is the 36th edition of the ICAPS conference series and will take place in Dublin, Ireland in June/July 2026.
